### Image 1: COS Brand Ecosystem Diagram

**Description:**
A dark-themed organizational map with "COS" at the center in bold red/white text. Six sub-brands orbit around the center, connected by red lines:
- COS Motors
- COS Promotions
- COS Music Group
- COS Underdogs
- Sin City Movement
- Team COS
Each brand uses minimalist icons (cars, microphones, etc.) with a tech-industrial color palette. The layout implies a centralized control model with shared resources across all verticals.

### Image 2: COS 7-Day Launch Checklist

**Description:**
A structured 7-day launch plan in grid format, with each day labeled:
- Day 1: Set up domain, website, and socials
- Day 2: Create promo videos
- Day 3: Launch content posts
- ...
The background is a faint urban scene with dark tones, and the text is bold and high-contrast. Each day's task is framed like a military operation. Intense energy, minimal design fluff.

### Image 3: Weekly Content Calendar (COS)

**Description:**
A weekly grid calendar with days of the week as columns and content categories as rows:
- Motors
- Music
- Promotions
- Quotes
- News
Each cell has a symbol or phrase indicating a content piece (e.g., "Video Drop," "Promo Clip," "Motivation Quote"). The design mimics a mission control schedule -- very disciplined, almost militant in layout.

### Image 4: COS Services Overview Graphic

**Description:**
A breakdown of COS services presented in a quadrant layout:
- Products
- Bookings
- Music Revenue
- Sponsorships
Icons are simple and monochromatic. Each quadrant includes a short headline and supporting tagline like "Revenue-driven brand management." This slide is designed to convince a client or partner of COS's reach and monetization pathways.

### Image 5: Website Architecture Mockup

**Description:**
Wireframe of the COS homepage layout:
- Top: Hero section with tagline and "Get In Touch" button
- Middle: Brand cards (COS Motors, Promotions, etc.)
- Bottom: Services and Contact
Layout uses grayscale with placeholder text and buttons. The structure matches the deployed GitHub Pages `index.html`. This image is a planning aid for site development and link structuring.
